My verry own Vim configuration
==============================

This is my personal configuration for Vim. If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me.

TODOs:
------
* use a plugin for filetype dependent beautification
* ~~look at vim-airline and perhaps choose it over vim-powerline~~
* search for a possibility to complete words from a language dictionary
